Application for Approval to Work More than 10 Hours per Week During Regular Semester

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to apply for approval to work more than 10 hours per week during the regular semester. I am currently enrolled in a study-related part-time internship in embedded systems at HKCRC (Hong Kong Construction Robotics Center), which I believe will greatly benefit my education and future career prospects.

The internship will provide me with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience and apply the knowledge that I have acquired in the classroom to real-world projects. I will be working on projects related to the development and control of robots for construction applications, which aligns perfectly with my major and interests. Additionally, the internship will expose me to industry standard practices and the latest technologies in embedded systems, which will help me stay current and competitive in the field. Furthermore, the internship offers flexible working hours with no hard-required working time, which means it will not interfere with my class schedule, allowing me to make the most of my time and gain the most benefits from the internship.

I am confident in my ability to handle multiple tasks effectively. My experience as a member of HKUST RoboMaster Robotics team for more than one year has helped me develop strong time management and organizational skills. I have learned how to prioritize my tasks and responsibilities to make the most of my time, and I am confident that this internship will not negatively impact my academic performance.

In order to balance my workload, I have carefully planned and arranged my study schedule and working schedule for the next semester. I plan to take 15 credits or so, including courses such as ELEC3300, ELEC2600, COMP3211, and ELEC3200. I have allocated Wednesdays afternoons and Fridays afternoons for the internship, so that I can focus on my studies during the rest of the week. I will also be utilizing my spare time in between classes to complete any assignments or projects that may be due for the internship.

I am fully committed to my studies and I assure you that I am capable of managing my time effectively to ensure that this internship will not negatively impact my academic performance. I kindly request your approval to work more than 10 hours per week during the regular semester and would greatly appreciate your positive consideration of my application.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely, [Your Name] [Your Student ID Number] [Your Contact Information]
